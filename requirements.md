i'm working on an app called voji. i want to create a web page to welcome potential users of voji by introducing its features, hero use cases, its functions. so users can understand why they might need it.


the webpage should have the following sections:
* Top bar: Floating: 
	** logo aligned to left: Voji (Google font: Pacifico, white color)
	** Menus aligned to right (collapse to hamburger button when screen is narrow, e.g. on mbile):
        *** Features
        *** Use cases
        *** Why Voji?
        *** Pricing
        *** 
* Hero section



Pricing section:

Free
(Good for getting started)
(pricing: always free)
* Capture ideas with voice
* Basic AI assistance
* Limited usage


Pro
(Unlock the full power of Voji)
(pricing: $4.99 per month billed yearly or $5.99 billed momthly)
* Everything in Free, plus:
* Customize app behavior and UI
* Full control over AI assistance
* Unlimited access to all features
* Priority access to new features
* (Future) Collaborative ideabooks



your task is help me design this webpage. 


output a detailed plan for the page structure, style, content etc so that i can implement it with cursor.
what i need for this page:
tell user what voji is
how they can use it
why they might find it unique.
how they can get it and give it a try (ios store, android store).
the page should feature:
clear call to action to download the voji app. (can repeat multiple times in the page)
a delightful, simplistic design that fit the voji app style. e.g. no round corner, google font pacifico for "voji" logo and afacad for text.
can change theme - light, dark, system
simple but appealing text. don't overwhelm the user with details.
images, screenshots with beautiful effect.
the page should scroll smoothly with animated effect like some apple product page.
the attached is a detailed doc about a lot of aspects of voji. you can refer to it. but you don't have to include all the information. remember: the web page is for future users. say the things that may convince them to try voji, not bore them with unnecessary details.
you can ask me clarification questions to make sure the requirements for this web page is clear.

for color palette, use this
"voji": "red:e76f51,orange:f4a261,yellow:e9c46a,green:8ab17d,blue:2a9d8f,purple:264653",
the primary color can be blue and red
Specific Animations: no specific in my mind. maybe just fan in, fan out, transitions etc
Domain: voji.app hosting: probably going to be firebase
Analytics: yes, but can be next step.
also add a waitlist, since voji is not online yet. let user add their email to the waitlist and they can get 60 days free pro when voji is up. just add the ui placeholder, let's worry about the implementing saving the emails later.
also add pricing:
free - forever free with some usage limit. limited ability to customize voji
pro - $5.99 per month and $59.99 per year. unlimited access to all features
don't include too many details of the usage limit and rate limit. just vaguely say free will have limits.
